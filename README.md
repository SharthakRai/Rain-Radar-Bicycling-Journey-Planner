# Rain-Radar Bicycling Journey Planner
The goal of this research project is to map out routes that will avoid adverse weather. Short-term weather forecasts are precise and extremely localized; we can now foresee, for example, if we will be caught in the rain on our way home, which is especially handy if commuting by foot or bicycle. It is possible to pinpoint the time and route to avoid (or minimize) poor weather by fetching weather forecast information and rain radar data. I will design and build a software system that will fetch the weather forecast at the time of departure, present a full weather forecast report along the route, recommend the best departure time and route to avoid poor weather, and provide notifications when the advised route/time changes due to weather forecast updates.
